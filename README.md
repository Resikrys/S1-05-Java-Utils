# SPRINT 1
## TASK 4: Java Utils

### LEVEL 1 - EXERCISE 1
Create a class that lists alphabetically the contents of a 
directory received by parameter.

### LEVEL 1 - EXERCISE 2
Add to the class from the previous exercise the functionality 
of listing a directory tree with the content of all its levels 
(recursively) so that they are printed on the screen in alphabetical 
order within each level, also indicating whether it is a directory 
(D) or a file (F), and its last modification date.

### LEVEL 1 - EXERCISE 3
Modify the previous exercise. Now, instead of displaying the result 
on the screen, save the result in a TXT file.

### LEVEL 1 - EXERCISE 4
Add the functionality to read any TXT file and display its 
contents on the console.

### LEVEL 1 - EXERCISE 5
Now the program must serialize a Java Object to a .ser file and 
then deserialize it.
